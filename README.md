# Airline Revenue Optimization Dashboard

Overview
The Airline Revenue Optimization Dashboard is a web application designed to capture, manage, and optimize airline revenue by tracking volume commitments, commissions, and Performance Linked Bonuses (PLBs). This project integrates real-time data analytics, enabling airlines to meet their revenue goals through actionable insights and nudge controls.

The project is built using a micro-frontend architecture with React, TypeScript, and Module Federation, and the backend is powered by Java and Spring Boot.

Features
Real-time Revenue Tracking: Monitor airline revenue, commissions, PLBs, and volume commitments.
Nudge Controls: Administrators can adjust nudge levels (e.g., Mild, Medium, Aggressive) to optimize revenue outcomes.
Comprehensive Dashboard: Visual representation of KPIs, revenue breakdowns, and actionable insights.
RESTful API Integration: Seamlessly interacts with the backend to fetch and update data.
